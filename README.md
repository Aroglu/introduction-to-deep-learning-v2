# Introduction to Deep Learning
Although deep learning is a sub-branch of machine learning, it has become a profession and a field of expertise today. This is because it performs much better than conventional machine learning techniques, especially in Image processing and Natural language processing.

This course is a great introductory course that gives you an explanatory introduction to the sub-branches of Deep Learning and how neural networks work, developed and optimized, which allows you to solve more complex AI problems.

With this course, you will understand how the most promising and surprising artificial intelligence projects affect our lives and the underlying technologies. In this course, where the most popular deep learning libraries are used, you will develop projects using Python language, and you will have the skills needed to start your career in this field.
